      <description>When configuring two interfaces, each on a different subnet, you must add an additional routing table to isolate interface traffic (e.g. eth0 in, eth0 out).
1. Create a routing table. In our example we create a table named &amp;lsquo;secondary&amp;rsquo; with identifier 252:

Here is how you would statically assign an IP, Netmask, Gateway, and DNS servers with ifconfig and route and the equivalent commands in ip:
$ ifconfig eth0 up $ ip link set eth0 up Configure your IP and Netmask:</description>
