<p>
OpenSSH allows you to add configuration directives to <span class="mono">~/.ssh/config</span> with aliases for long hostnames or IP addresses:  

{% highlight bash %}
cat << EOF >> ~/.ssh/config
Host segv                     # desired alias
    HostName segv.me          # ip address works too
    Port 22
    User foo
    LocalForward localhost:57005 192.168.0.2:57005
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/auxiliary_rsa
EOF
{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>
This solution is better than using <span class="mono">/etc/hosts</span> for obvious reasons. There are a great number of options that allow you choose everything from username to encryption cipher preferences on a host-by-host basis.
</p>
<p>
<span class="mono">man ssh_config</span>
</p>
</p>

I've added a nasty little bashism too, as a bonus.
