Rails is an ideal of convenience and terse syntactic power coated in elegance - a Ruby DSL.

<p>
Pushes the Pragmatic Programmer agenda, which harmonizes developer-manager and developer-client relationships.

Rails has done more than anything ever before to help people know that REST exists and that it is important.
