</p>
Bash has many advanced features that may not be enabled by default, and as an avid wildcard wielder I find <span class="mono">extglob</span> especially useful.
</p>

<p>
I use <b>inverse pattern matching</b> most frequently, for example:
</p>


{% highlight bash %}
$ ls
bar     baz     foo.jpg     quux
                   ^
$ ls !(*.jpg)
bar  baz  quux

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
To enable extglob, simply run:
</p>

<pre style="font-size: 17px">
$ shopt -s extglob
</pre>

<pre style="font-size: 14px">
  If the extglob shell option is enabled using the shopt builtin, several extended  pattern  matching  operators are recognized.  In the following description, a pattern-list is a list of one or more patterns separated by a |.  

Composite patterns may be formed using one or more of the following sub-patterns:

       ?(pattern-list)
              Matches zero or one occurrence of the given pattern               
       *(pattern-list)
              Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns
       +(pattern-list)
              Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns
       @(pattern-list)
              Matches one of the given patterns
       !(pattern-list)
              Matches anything except one of the given patterns
</pre>
