I was surprised to find out that ifconfig and route are actually deprecated,
despite their ubiquity.

Even more unfortunate, their replacement, namely the ip command, doesn't seem
to have any concern for the readability of its output.

Here is how you would statically assign an IP, Netmask, Gateway, and DNS
servers with ifconfig and route and the equivalent commands in ip:

```bash
$ ifconfig eth0 up

$ ip link set eth0 up
```

Configure your IP and Netmask:
```bash
$ ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.0

$ ip addr add 192.168.1.3/24 dev eth0
```

Configure a route to your default Gateway:
```bash
$ route add default gw 192.168.1.1

$ ip route add default via 192.168.1.1
```
