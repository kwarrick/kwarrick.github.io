By default, comments are disabled in zsh's interactive interpreter:

{% highlight bash %}
[warrick@maca ~] % # comment
zsh: bad pattern: #
{% endhighlight %}
</p>

I find this to be an incredibly annoying default, but here is how you enable such comments:

{% highlight bash %}
[warrick@maca ~] % setopt interactivecomments
{% endhighlight %}<p>
