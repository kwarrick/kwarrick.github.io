After watching Peter Cooper's _Ruby Trick Shots_ I wanted to experiment
with loading dynamic libraries in Ruby as he demoed. 

Maddeningly, when I tried to require `fiddle`, Ruby was throwing a `LoadError`:

```txt
LoadError: cannot load such file -- fiddle
```

Digging into the RVM logs in ~/.rvm/log/ruby-1.9.3-p0, I found that when RVM
compiled Ruby it failed to find the `ffi.h` header and
subsequently did not install fiddle.

```bash
$ grep -A 2 fiddle ~/.rvm/log/ruby-1.9.3-p0/make.log 
configuring fiddle
ffi.h is missing. Please install libffi.
...
```

So, as usual this is a dependency problem and your solution is an apt-get away:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libffi5 libffi-dev
```


Now, I can finally run Peter's code:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'fiddle'

libc = DL.dlopen "libc.so.6"

f = Fiddle::Function.new(libc['strlen'],
                         [Fiddle::TYPE_VOIDP],
                         Fiddle::TYPE_INT)

p f.call("foo").to_i
```
