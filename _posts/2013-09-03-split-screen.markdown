GNU screen allows you to split your screen session into independently operable windows.

{% highlight text %}
CTRL + a + S                - horizontal split
CTRL + a + TAB              - change split
CTRL + a + X                - kill current split
CTRL + a + :resize N        - resize to N lines
{% endhighlight %}<p>
