<ol>
<li>division of primitive datatypes and objects is ungodly annoying</li>
<li>System.arraycopy(), no camelCase you standard fascists?</li>
<li>.length vs .size(), why does a para-primitive have an attribute anyways?</li>
<li>lack of unsigned data types</li>
<li>Date, Time, Calendar are a colossal cluster-f* unless your favorite word is Deprecated.</li>
<li>System.out.println, this is one of the most common output and debugging methods, why is it 18 characters? NO, static imports do not mitigate the idiocy.</li>
<li>Anonymous inner classes are poor alternatives to lambdas.</li>
<li>Generics are broken and Type Erasure for backwards compatibility is simply ridiculous.</li>
<li>No operator overloading? Oh, I understand I'm too dumb to use them for any good.</li>
<li>implicit + operator overload for Strings, but no == and != operator (e.g. "foo" + "bar" but no "foo" == "bar")</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
On top of it all, Java is a horrendous teaching language.  It is incredible how much handwaving goes into just a simple "hello world". Oh, just ignore this class keyword and this public static void main, and oh we'll learn about String args[] in a few lectures. Here we are, System.out.println. Pshh.
