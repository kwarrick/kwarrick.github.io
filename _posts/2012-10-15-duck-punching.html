Heh, monkey patching is also called "duck punching".<br />

<blockquote cite="http://www.ericdelabar.com/2008/05/metaprogramming-javascript.html">
Well, I was just totally sold by Adam, the idea being that if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's a duck, right? So if this duck is not giving you the noise that you want, you've got to just punch that duck until it returns what you expect.
