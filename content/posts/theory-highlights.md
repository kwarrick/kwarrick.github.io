"This discussion highlights an important difference between complexity theory and computability theory. In computability theory, the Church-Turing thesis implies that all reasonable models of computation are equivalent - that is, they all decide the same class of languages. In complexity theory, the choice of model affects the time complexity of languages. Languages that are decidable in, say, linear time on one model aren't necessarily decidable in linear time on another."

 "The same language may have different time requirements on different models."
</p>

<p>
"We show that any language that is decidable on [a nondeterministic single-tape machine] is decidable on a deterministic single-tape Turing machine that requires significantly more time."

Thanks Sipser, when I'm not being tested on the subject your book is really quite swell.

So a NP problem only takes polynomial time on a nondeterministic Turing machine, which has infinite parallelism. Think NFA that splits each time it encounters multiple possible paths. Every NFA has an equivalent DFA; however, when that NFA is converted to an equivalent DFA the number of states may be exponential in the number of states in the NFA.

"First, note the dramatic difference between the growth rate of a typically occurring polynomials such as n<sup>3</sup> and typically occurring exponentials such as 2<sup>n</sup>. For example, let n be 1000, the size of a reasonable input to an algorithm. In that case, n<sup>3</sup> is 1 billion, a large but manageable number, whereas 2<sup>n</sup> is a number much larger than the number of atoms in the universe. Polynomial time algorithms are fast enough for many purposes, but exponential time algorithms rarely are useful."
