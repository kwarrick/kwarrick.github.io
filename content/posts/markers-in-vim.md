Just started using markers in VIM to quickly navigate to places in my code. 
```txt
mr        - set marker r, where r can be a-z
'r        - jump to mark stored in register r, beginning of line
`r        - jump to position stored in register r, exact position
```

New or aspiring VIM users like myself should read these:
