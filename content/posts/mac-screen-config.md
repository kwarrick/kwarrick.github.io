I haven't written a post in a long while, and this post isn't as short and sweet. I have grown to a level of productivity with my MacBook that I've never experienced elsewhere. Here is why and some of my configuration:
</p>

<p>
I use the command (âŒ˜) key extensively, and it is this extra control key that makes me prefer my MacBook for coding and hacking about to my Linux desktop. (Linux is still closest to my heart.)
</p>
<p>
Why? I use the Terminal extensively. All day, every day. Copying and Pasting with âŒ˜ + c and âŒ˜ + v is much more natural and convenient than Ctrl+Shift+c and Ctrl+shift+v. You won't know how much you miss it until you switch back.
</p>

<p>
Next, I am absolutely attached to two features of Mac OS X screens that Linux simply doesn't have. 

<pre>
1. Click-and-hold window whilst changing screen.
2. Assigning an application to a specific screen.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
I have 5 screens configured because that is the farthest my fingers reach with a thumb-middle-finger combo without any stretching or wrist movement, which brings me to my preferred key sequence for changing screens, Command (âŒ˜) + N, where N is the number of the screen.
</p>

<p>
So, to make this more useful I assign certain applications to certain screens so that my desire or need for an application becomes mechanical like shifting gears:

<pre>
âŒ˜ + 1   --  Terminal, System Preferences
âŒ˜ + 2   --  Text Editors (TextMate and TextEdit)
âŒ˜ + 3   --  Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
âŒ˜ + 4   --  Mail and Chat clients (Adium)
âŒ˜ + 5   --  Virtual Machines 
</pre>
</p>

<p>
That's it, and it is magical.
