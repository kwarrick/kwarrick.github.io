I love bash. <br />
I really really love bash, and I use it all the time. Because I use it all the time, I've taken a liking to a few <span class="mono">readline</span> shortcuts. Readline is a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">GNU</a> library bash uses which "allows users to edit command lines as they are typed in." Actually, you can thank <span class="mono">readline</span> for the handy history and tab auto-completion functionality.

<pre style="font-size: 18px">
CTRL + w	delete previous word
CTRL + e	jump to end of line
CTRL + a	jump to the beginning of line
CTRL + u	delete entire line before cursor
CTRL + k	delete entire line after cursor
CTRL + y	restore previously deleted word,line,etc.
CTRL + l	clear the screen
</pre>
