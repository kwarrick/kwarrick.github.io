Seven years I have been using Mac OS X, and this entire time I have hated
moving my hand to the mouse to select the "Don't Save" button on exit dialog
menus. 

Well, I finally looked up the shortcut and then I promptly forgot it. This
time, I am writing it down. Here it is, and I hope it helps.

**Command-D**

```
Selects "Don't Save" in dialogs that contain a Don't Save button, in Mac OS X v10.6.8 and earlier
```

**Command-Delete**

```
Selects "Don't Save" in dialogs that contain a Don't Save button, in OS X Lion and Mountain Lion
```
