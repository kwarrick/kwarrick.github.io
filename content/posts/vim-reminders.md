1) I always trounce my yank buffer when I delete lines. Don't forget that registers 0-9 are a history of the past 10 <b>yank buffers</b>.

<pre>
"0p    ...    "9p
</pre>
</p>

2) Sometimes, when doing a global search and replace, it is convenient to be <b>prompted</b> before replacing each string.

<pre>
%s/foo/bar/gc
</pre>
</p>
